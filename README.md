# MyReads Project

This is the project made for the Udacity React Nanodegree. In this project, we make use of the powerful [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to build a "Would You Rather" game. 

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

# Courtesy

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
